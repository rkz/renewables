# Renewable electricity study

## Motivation

**Is France really lagging behind other countries** in terms of renewable power deployment? Could we do better without too much sacrifice?

Let's fact check it.

## Results

![Countries with energy ~ FR, wind/solar density >~ FR, GHG < 15t](result/plot.png)

Portugal, Spain, Italy (and Greece to a lesser extent) tackle the triple challenge of:
1. a higher wind/solar density than France;
2. an acceptable carbon footprint (for now);
3. an energy use yet compatible with good living standards.
